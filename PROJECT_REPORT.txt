# WebAssist Project Report

This report summarizes the development progress of the WebAssist project based on the ongoing conversation.

**Project Overview:** WebAssist is a Django-based web application aimed at providing users with tools to monitor and analyze their websites. The current focus is on implementing features like PageSpeed Insights integration, Uptime Monitoring, and SSL certificate checks.

**Completed Tasks:**

*   Successfully set up and configured the GitHub Actions CI pipeline, resolving issues related to import formatting (`isort`, `black`) and missing environment variables (`DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`, `PSI_API_KEY`).
*   Migrated the project to a new GitHub repository.
*   Addressed local environment setup issues, including installing necessary dependencies (`dj-database-url`).
*   Implemented initial structures for user API key management.
*   Started the implementation of the Uptime Monitoring feature, including updating the `Link` model, creating a service for UptimeRobot, and adding basic views and templates.
*   Initiated the process of consolidating the 'Sites' page functionality into the 'Dashboard'.
*   Fixed a `TemplateSyntaxError` in the `settings.html` template.

**In Progress:**

*   Consolidating the functionality of the 'Sites' page into the 'Dashboard'.
*   Further developing the Uptime Monitoring feature to include history and detailed reports.
*   Integrating other planned features such as SSL certificate checks and Security Headers analysis.
*   Refining the user interface for managing API keys.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Complete the dashboard consolidation.
2.  Finalize the Uptime Monitoring feature.
3.  Proceed with implementing other roadmap features (SSL, Security Headers, etc.).
4.  Enhance the API key settings UI.
5.  Continue addressing any issues that arise.
